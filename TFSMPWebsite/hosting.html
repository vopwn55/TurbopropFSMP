            <p>In order for the TFSMP server to work, you'll need:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Basic computer literacy and an understanding of networks</b></li>
                <li>A Windows or Linux-based system</li>
                <li>Python 3.10.0 or higher</li>
                <li>Pip3</li>
            </ul>
            <p>If you plan on making the server public, you might need an external IP or a hosting service that provides one. The TFSMP server doesn't work well with proxies.</p>
            <h2 style="margin-top:0.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><a href="#installation" style="color:black; text-decoration: none; font-size: 110%;">Installation</a></h2>
            <p>
                Download the server in case you haven't done that yet. 
                The server will be located in a .zip file, which you need to extract. 
                The extraction location does not matter but ensure that you have sufficient permissions to access files in it. 
                For Windows, it's recommended to place the server in your Documents folder. 
                For Linux, it's recommended to place it in your home folder.
                <br><br>
                Once the server is extracted, execute the AutoSetup.py script in it.
                The script will check for updates and install necessary modules, and ask you to set up basic settings.
                You may either complete the setup wizard or skip it.
                The TFSMP settings are contained in a file called config.json, you may edit the file to change settings.
                It's recommended to keep the default settings, unless you know what you're doing.
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top:0.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><a href="#running" style="color:black; text-decoration: none; font-size: 110%;">Running</a></h2>
            <p>
                In order to launch the TFSMP server, you need to run the Server.py file in the server folder.
                On Windows, there is a shortcut included (Start the TFSMP Server.lnk) that you can use to conveniently launch the server.
                If you see "Server running on (your address)", then the server is working correctly and is ready to receive connections!
            </p>
            <h2 style="margin-top:0.1em; margin-bottom: 0.5em;"><a href="#running" style="color:black; text-decoration: none; font-size: 110%;">Plugins</a></h2>
            <p>
                Plugins can extend the functionality of your TFSMP server.
                Plugins are divided into two variants: server-side plugins and client-side plugins.
                The names explain everything: server-side plugins run on your server, whereas client-side plugins run on the connected clients.
                Server-side plugins are written in Python and client-side plugins are written in Voscript.
                By default, there is one server-side plugin included: Security Essentials 2024.
                You can install extra plugins or write your own.
