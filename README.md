# TurbopropFSMP
This is a read-only repository containing the source code of the former Turboprop FS Multiplayer mod, published for educational purposes. You are free to use the code as you wish, however I strictly recommend against using it in production as it is severly flawed. This mod is discontinued, so please do not suggest fixes or new features.
